    "    \"body\": \"01 October 2024, Israel, Tel Aviv: Missiles launched from Iran are seen in the sky over Tel Aviv. Ilia Yefimovich/dpa | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\\\\n\\\\nMarkets are in danger of being \\\\\"whipsawed\\\\\" by the combination of regional conflict in the Middle East and rising unemployment in the United States, says Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale Law Schools Paul Tsai China Center. The conflict in the Middle East escalated on Tuesday, with Iran launching a ballistic missile attack on Israel after its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and an Iranian commander in Lebanon. Most Asian markets fell on Wednesday, tracking losses on Wall Street overnight, as investors fretted over rising tensions in the Middle East. \\\\\"The markets really will not know where to turn,\\\\\" Roach said, adding that conflicts in the Middle East are adding to inflationary risks at a time when global central banks are starting to ease monetary policy. \\\\\"We are likely to see significant increases in volatility and markets that really are whipped back and forth dramatically,\\\\\" Roach told CNBCs \\\\\"Squawk Box Asia\\\\\" on Wednesday.\\\\n\\\\nOil market impact\\\\n\\\\nThe Israel Defense Forces said its troops had started launching new strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response to Irans missile attack Tuesday night. It remains to be seen whether there will be lasting effects on inflation, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander, adding that the oil market will be \\\\\"affected more significantly\\\\\" if the tension escalates.\\\\n\\\\nwatch now\\\\n\\\\nIran is the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping out nearly four million barrels of oil per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Oil prices had jumped over 5% after the missile strike before tapering to a 2% climb.\\\\n\\\\nOutlook for interest rates\\\\n\\\\nThe Israeli response to Irans attacks \\\\\"might throw the Feds 25-basis-point rate cut off track,\\\\\" said Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. The U.S. Federal Reserve projected cutting interest rates by another half point over the next two policy meetings this year, according to the central banks so-called dot plot from the September meeting. Traders are also looking to U.S. payroll data on Friday for more indications on the state of the economy after the U.S. Federal Reserves jumbo rate cut in September. A higher-than-expected unemployment rate could prompt the Fed to accelerate the easing cycle to achieve a soft landing. The unemployment rate in September is expected to come in at 4.2%, according to data of a Reuters poll on LSEG, unchanged from the August figure. The unemployment rate had jumped to near a three-year high of 4.3% in July, a dramatic rise from the five-decade low of 3.4% in April 2023.\\\\n\\\\nwatch now\"\n",

    "    \"headline\": \"Martin Lewis explains 'good way' to make up to £200 for free before Christmas\",\n",
    "    \"body\": \"Martin Lewis has explained how you could make up to £200 before Christmas by switching bank account. The MoneySavingExpert flagged five bank accounts that will pay you for your service - four of which will send you the cash before December 25. All of the bank switches flagged by Martin Lewis must be completed using the free Current Account Switch Service. But make sure you read all the terms and conditions first - as sometimes you may need to pay in a certain amount, or carry over direct debits.\\n\\nSpeaking during his Martin Lewis Money Show Live Christmas special, Martin said: “If you love your bank… then stick with it. I wouldn't tell you to leave. If not, then so many banks are willing to pay you.” He added: “It's a good way to make free cash and get it in time for Christmas.”\\n\\nWhen you switch bank accounts, your direct debits and standing orders will automatically be moved across, but for any recurring payments that use your long card number, most commonly with subscription services, you’ll need to update these manually. If you’re considering multiple switches, and you’ve got an important credit application coming up, Martin issued a word of warning. He said: “If you do one switch, well, it's an application on your credit file which has a very minor, short term negative effect. Lots of those in a short space of time can be an impact. Banks also like to see evidence of longevity, so that's also slightly negative. So I wouldn't switch my bank account if I had a mortgage application during the next two months.\\n\\n“Longer than that, I wouldn't care that much. It's only very minor. It doesn't really have a hit. Switching very regularly to make money can have a bigger impact. Do you have a use for your credit working? Do you have a debt application you want to make, or a mortgage application you want to make? No, well, in which case it'll have an effect, but why’d you care?”\\n\\nHow to make up to £200 switching bank accounts\\n\\nLloyds Bank: You'll get £200 if you switch to a Club Lloyds account by December 10. Club Lloyds customers can also choose from a range of lifestyle benefits, including a 12-month Disney+ subscription, a choice of six cinema tickets, magazine subscription, or Coffee Club and Gourmet Society membership.\\n\\nYou also get access to a linked regular saver paying 6.25% fixed for one year. To get the £200 switch cash, you need to move across three direct debits. Once you've done this, the £200 is paid within ten working days. You won't be eligible for the £200 switch cash if you've already received a switch bonus from Lloyds, Bank of Scotland or Halifax since April 2020. Keep in mind there is a £3 monthly fee with the Club Lloyds Account but this is waived if you pay in £2,000 a month.\\n\\nNatWest: NatWest is giving away £180 to those who move to its NatWest Reward account. You’ll need to pay in £1,250 into your new NatWest account and log into the mobile app within 60 days of switching accounts. Once you’ve done this, the £180 will be paid within seven days. The NatWest Reward account comes with a monthly fee of £2 - but it is possible to get £5 cashback, which wipes out this cost. Every month, you can get £4 cashback if you have two direct debits of £2 or more, plus £1 cashback by logging into the mobile app. NatWest also offers a linked Digital Regular Saver which pays 6% interest. You won't be eligible for the £180 switch award if you've previously received a switch bonus from NatWest, RBS or Ulster Bank before.\\n\\nFirst Direct: You can get £175 by switching to the First Direct 1st Account. For this switch bonus, you must pay in at least £1,000 and open two direct debits or standing orders from the account within 45 days of opening it. You must also register and log onto digital banking, within 45 days of the account opening and spend on your debit card five times.\\n\\nYou must be a \\\"new\\\" customer of First Direct to get this cash - this means you must not have had a bank account with them, or opened an HSBC current account on or after January 1, 2018. If you have a HSBC account, it must have been opened before this date. The £175 is paid by the 20th of the following month after you meet the switch bonus criteria. It's worth noting as well that you get access to a 7% regular saver for a year with the 1st Account.\\n\\nNationwide: Nationwide is giving £175 to those who switch their current account to its FlexDirect account. To qualify, you must transfer a minimum of two active direct debits, deposit a minimum of £1,000 and make one debit card payment within 31 days.\\n\\nYou also get access to a linked regular saver paying 6.5% variable interest for a year. You won't be eligible if you have switched into a Nationwide account, or have received switch cash from Nationwide, since August 18, 2021. The £175 is paid within 10 days of meeting all the criteria.\\n\\nSantander: You can get £150 from Santander - but be warned that the money won't arrive before Christmas. To get this cash, you need to switch across two direct debits and pay in at least £1,500. If you switch to the Santander Edge account, there is a £3 monthly fee - but you can get up to £20 a month cashback. This includes 1% on energy, council tax, broadband, TV, mobile and water bills, up to £10, as well another 1% on your spending on supermarket, fuel and trains, also up to £10. You also get a linked saver that pays 6% on up to £4,000 for the first year.\"\n",

    "    \"headline\": \"Should I fix my mortgage for two or five years right now?\",\n",
    "    \"body\":\"My wife and I are remortgaging at the end of the year and trying to weigh up our options between a two-year and a five-year fixed rate mortgage.\\n\\nWhat's your view? There isn't a huge difference in monthly repayments between the two, but trying to get a sense of what will happen to interest rates in the future is a challenge.\\n\\nNew normal? Fixed mortgage rates have been heading higher in recent weeks, despite the Bank of England cutting interest rates earlier this month\\n\\nEd Magnus of This is Money replies: This question is being asked a lot at the moment. As households continue to roll off their fixed rate deals - some of whom may have been paying as little as 1 per cent interest, the stakes now seem much higher, given they now have to fix above 4 per cent. Although five-year fixes are usually slightly cheaper at the moment, the difference between two-year and five-year mortgage rates has narrowed in recent weeks making this decision even harder.\\n\\nWhat are today's mortgage rates?\\n\\nThe lowest two-year fixed remortgage rate is now 4.27 per cent compared to 4.07 per cent for the lowest five-year fix.\\n\\nOn a £200,000 mortgage being repaid over 25 years, that's the difference between paying £1,086 and £1,063 each month. The average five-year fix is now 5.22 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, compared to the average two-year rate of 5.5 per cent.\\n\\nHowever, two-year fixes are the product of choice at the moment.\\n\\nLast month, Santander said 60 per cent of customers were choosing two-year fixes at present. For many, this is because they hope interest rates will be lower when they come to remortgage in two years' time.\\n\\nLess than a quarter of Santander customers are opting for five-year fixed rate products, even though they are currently cheaper. The remainder are mostly choosing fixes lasting three or ten years, or trackers.\\n\\nWhen will mortgage rates fall?\\n\\nJust because the majority of households are fixing for two years, does not mean they are necessarily right.\\n\\nMany households will be opting for two-year fixes because the consensus is that interest rates will continue to fall and mortgage rates will follow suit. It is true that the Bank of England has started reducing the base rate - a trend which leads to lower mortgage rates in general.\\n\\nHowever, future interest rate cuts by the Bank of England are already baked into fixed rate mortgage pricing. This is why the lowest priced five-year fixed rate products are hovering just above 4 per cent, rather than above the Bank of England base rate at 4.75 per cent.\\n\\nPrior to the quickfire base rate rises between December 2021 and August 2023, the lowest mortgage rates have trended above base rate. That was the case at least between 2008 and 2022.\\n\\nMortgage pricing is largely based on Sonia swap rates - an inter-bank lending rate, based on future interest rate expectations.\\n\\nWhen Sonia swaps rise sufficiently it often results in fixed mortgage rates going up, and vice versa when they fall. As of 14 November, five-year swaps were at 4.01 per cent and two-year swaps were at 4.22 per cent. It is very rare for mortgage rates to go below the equivalent swaps.\\n\\nWhat happens to mortgage rate pricing in the future will depend largely on what happens to inflation as well as the wider economy. A sudden inflationary shock could send interest rates higher, while a recession could see the Bank of England cut rates more aggressively, for example.\\n\\nInflation forecast: The BoE expects the rate of inflation to hover just above 2% until 2027\\n\\nHow far will base rate fall?\\n\\nThe most bullish forecasters on rate cuts have base rate coming down to as low as 2.75 per cent by the end of 2025, with Goldman Sachs analysts announcing this rate forecast recently.\\n\\nGoldman's prognosis would mean a quarter point interest rate cut at all nine meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) from December 2024 to November 2025. At the more reserved end of the spectrum, Santander recently revealed it expects interest rates to fall to 3.75 per cent by the end of next year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, economists at Capital Economics think the base rate will fall to 3.5 per cent by early 2026. They had previously forecast that interest rates would fall to 3 per cent by the end of next year, but have concluded that rates will now fall more slowly as a result of the Labour's first Budget.\\n\\nNew forecast: Capital Economics has changed its interest rate forecast because it now thinks the Bank of England will cut rates more slowly as a result of the budget\\n\\nLooking further ahead, it is anyone's guess. Santander predicts that base rate will remain between 3 per cent and 4 per cent for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nMeanwhile economists at Oxford Economics are forecasting they will fall to a low of 2 per cent in 2027.\\n\\nIf Santander's prediction plays out, a five-year fixed rate mortgage could well play out to be the better option. But of course, if Oxford Economics are right, then you may wish you had gone for the two-year fix.\\n\\nHow long should you fix your mortgage?\\n\\nSo with all that in mind, how long should mortgage holders fix for now?\\n\\nWe spoke to Chris Sykes, technical director of broker Private Finance and Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients.\\n\\nChris Sykes replies: There are a few things to consider to help make your decision.\\n\\nFirst, the cost. Often mortgage deals have product fees attached to them, and there can also be legal fees, broker fees and early repayment charges to consider. It is worth taking these into consideration. Often people just look at the rate, but paying a £999 product fee every two years instead of every five years can add up over time, especially if added to the loan amount.\\n\\nWhat is loan-to-value?\"\n",

    "    \"body\":\"'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand\\n\\nNell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing – it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day. The company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress – now with over 50 designs – to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.\\n\\n\\\"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 – right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\\\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \\\"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.\\n\\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here.\\n\\n\\\"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\\\"\\n\\nSince then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (£118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation. The company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.\\n\\n\\\"We've had the biggest year in company history,\\\" Diamond said. \\\"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying\\n\\nDiamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.\\n\\n\\\"I was always drawn to retail,\\\" she says. \\\"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\\\"\\n\\nNow, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.\\n\\nI wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing – great British brands like [ interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. There were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [ approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and … start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.\\n\\nBy 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.\\n\\nHill House Home The Nap Dress has proved wildly popular with consumers, with new collections often selling out in minutes of going on sale (Credit: Hill House Home)\\n\\nWhy do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?\\n\\nIt's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [ the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back.\"\n",

But, we are yet to see anything that speaks to the unique challenges faced by the self-employed. They seem to be ignored or forgotten. This neglect is worrying, given the increasing number of people opting for (or being pushed into) full-time self-employment. And at a time when we hear so much rhetoric about supporting and nourishing entrepreneurial spirit in the UK. We published data earlier this year which should ring alarm bells for policymakers. In a self-employed survey using Opinium Research, we found that 60 per cent have less than £10,000 in pension wealth, and 38 per cent have no pension savings at all. Once again, the gender pensions gap shows itself, too – with 43 per cent of women having no pension compared to 35 per cent of men. But this isn’t just about pensions, self-employed workers are also dangerously financially exposed more broadly. In fact, 15 per cent have no cash savings at all, and 31 per cent have less than £1,000 saved. Plus, our research also found that most self-employed workers do not have any other significant investment.\\n\\nIt’s high time policymakers paid greater attention to this often-overlooked segment of the workforce. There needs to be a concerted effort to integrate self-employed workers into the pension conversation, offering them a comprehensive level of support and resources in the same league as what’s available to salaried employees. At Interactive Investor, we have long been very vocal on the need for greater financial literacy in the UK, but let’s also see some enhanced pension education to actually improve the awareness of existing services like Pension Wise to help the self-employed make informed retirement decisions. We’d also like to see the expansion of the Pensions Wise Access service, offering the service to self-employed individuals of all ages, automatically scheduling appointments when they register as sole traders or submit tax returns. Think of the difference even those changes could make.\\n\\nWe’d also like to see the implementation of an automatic opt-in model linked to the self-assessment tax return to increase pension contributions. And finally, but crucially – pension dashboards. We’d like to see policymakers develop dashboards tailored to the self-employed which will help them get a clear view of their retirement savings and have better management of contributions. The reality of financial abuse in relationships\\n\\nThis week, I saw new research from Gina Miller’s organisation Moneyshe, stating that a third of women feel trapped in a relationship or situation due to a lack of financial independence. Their campaign is calling for women to invest to fight back against financial abuse, raising awareness of the gender investment gap in the UK and the importance of personal financial resilience and security.\\n\\nI completely agree that helping more women build their own financial independence and resilience is vital. At Interactive Investor, we’ve done a lot of work on the various ‘gaps’ when it comes to women and their money. But, we must remember that financial abuse, a form of coercive control, is complex. Sadly, a staggering one in six women in the UK has experienced financial abuse in a relationship, according to the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. And though still not talked about enough, some very courageous female commentators in my industry have spoken about financial abuse in depth, and have outlined steps women can take to get help. The Surviving Economic Abuse website has a range of useful resources, as well as helplines you can call if you or someone you know is in a financially abusive relationship. Just know that help is available.\\n\\nMaking your money work hard under inflation\\n\\nLast week, inflation nudged back above the Bank of England’s two per cent target in October. Hitting 2.3 per cent, it was a sharp increase of 0.6 per cent, and with both services and core inflation speeding up last month, too, the prospect of a December interest rate cut is now looking faint. This is a crucial reminder of why you need to ensure your savings and investments work harder to grow in real terms. This means checking how much you’re earning on your savings, and shopping around for the best deals.\\n\\nRemember, investing in the stock market gives you the potential to grow your money significantly faster than inflation and savings accounts, albeit with higher risk. So, it will always depend on your individual circumstances, but if you’re in it for the long term, your investments will have longer to recover if the market takes a dip. Plus, regular, monthly investments can also help smooth out the impact of stock market volatility on returns from investing.\\n\\nAnd, we can’t talk about investing without talking about keeping an eye on fees. The good news is investment costs are one of the few things you can control. Investing will never be free, but it doesn’t have to be expensive either! Keeping your fees low can help your portfolio outpace inflation by a wider margin.\"\n",
